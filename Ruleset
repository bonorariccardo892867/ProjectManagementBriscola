The traditional Italian-suited pack used for briscola consists of forty cards, divided into four suits: coins (Denari), swords (Spade), cups (Coppe) and batons (Bastoni).

The values on the cards range numerically from one through seven, plus three face cards in each suit: knave (fante), knight (cavallo), and king (re). 
The knave depict a man standing, the knight is on horseback and the king wears a crown.

Below is a table identifying card rank and point values:

Cards, by rank:		Point value:
Ace (asso) 		    11
Three (tre)		    10
King (re)		      4
Knight (Cavallo) 	3
Knave (Fante)		  2
Others			      0

The deck has 120 card points in total. To win a game, a player must accumulate more points than any other player. If both players have the same number of points (60) another game is played to determine the winner.

PLAYING PHASE

After the deck is shuffled, both players are dealt three cards. The next card is placed face up on the playing surface.. This card sets the briscola, and represents the trump suit for the game. This move may only be done at the beginning of the game or first hand.
The player who has the first turn plays one card face up on the playing surface. The other player subsequently plays a card in turn. 
The winner of that trick is determined as follows:

- If any briscola (trump) has been played, the player who played the highest valued trump wins.

- If no briscolas (trumps) have been played, the player who played the highest card of the lead suit wins.

Unlike other trump card games, players are not required to follow suit, that is, playing the same suit as the lead player is not required.
Once the winner of a trick is determined, that player collects the played cards. Then, each player draws a card from the remaining deck, starting with the player who won the trick. Note that the last card collected in the game should be the up-turned briscola. The player who won the trick leads to the next.

SCORING

After all the cards have been played, players calculate the value of the cards they have collected. 
In partnership games, the partners combine their points. 61 card points are needed to win and 60-all is a draw.
